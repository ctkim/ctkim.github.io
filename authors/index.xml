      <description>&lt;p&gt;was born in South Korea and moved to NYC when she was 9 years old. Ever since she got her hands on her mom&amp;rsquo;s old camcorder, she acted in her own short films with her uncooperative brother. She graduated from Brandeis University in 2017 with a B.A. in film (and a B.S. in Computer Science), and has lived in Queens ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine loves telling stories in any creative capacity. She is especially passionate about tackling issues surrounding identity through the lens of class, race, citizenship, and sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, she splits her time between acting, producing, and trying to revive her sourdough starter.&lt;/p&gt;
