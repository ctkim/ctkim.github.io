      <description>&lt;p&gt;was born in a small town in South Korea and moved to NYC when she was 9 years old. Ever since she got her hands on her mom&amp;rsquo;s old camcorder, she has made and acted in films. She graduated from Brandeis University in 2017 with a B.A. in film, and has lived in Queens ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She loves telling stories in any creative capacity. She&amp;rsquo;s especially passionate about demonstrating the world through the viewpoint of a working class immigrant background and the Asian American experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, she splits her time between acting, kickboxing, and writing (allegedly) witty Facebook statuses.&lt;/p&gt;
