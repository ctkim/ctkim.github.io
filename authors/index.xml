      <description>&lt;p&gt;was born in a small town in South Korea and moved to NYC when she was 9 years old. Ever since she got her hands on her mom&amp;rsquo;s old camcorder, she made videos and acted out her imaginary stories. She graduated from Brandeis University in 2017 with a B.A. in film (with a B.S. in Computer Science), and has lived in Queens ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She loves telling stories in any creative capacity. She is especially passionate about discovering the world through the eyes of a working class immigrant and highlighting the queer Asian American experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, she splits her time between acting, writing code, and trying to revive her sourdough starter.&lt;/p&gt;
