      <title>Filmmaking During A Pandemic</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;filmmaking-is-more-accessible-than-ever&#34;&gt;Filmmaking is more accessible than ever.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should crave for perfection, but understand that we&amp;rsquo;ll never attain it. With that in mind, we should create. We all have cameras in our pockets. Filmmaking is within anyone&amp;rsquo;s reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;ll be honest. When a short video hosting platform reached out to me to create a series of scripted videos for them, I almost declined. By this point, New York City was under deep quarantine and I was depressed that all my acting prospects went up in smoke. How would I create? I only had limited equipment, no crew, no actors. I felt like I had nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I struggled with the decision for a while. But, as I do with most things in life, I grudgingly accepted the responsibility. And I’m so glad that I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creativity isn’t confined to the four walls of your apartment. It might even flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to tell a sweet, humorous story about an alien who came to Earth to learn more about the species. She came to find the definition of love. In vignettes, you can see how she sees the mundane world with fresh eyes of somebody who’s never experienced it before. The seemingly banal realities of life blossom into precious and memorable moments for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She doesn’t interact with anyone else on screen. She’s always alone, and she struggles with that too. But despite the physical distance, human connection is something that permeates the very air we breathe. We can’t survive without it. We couldn’t avoid it if we tried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I filmed this on my phone, with the help of a broken selfie-stick and my mom. Many kudos to her, she was able to get the shots we needed like a champ. There’s a strange buzzing sensation you get when you cross items off on your shot list. It felt great to have that excitement course through my veins again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My art will never be perfect in my eyes. But I’m proud of it regardless.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Slate Your Name, Please</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;for-those-unfamiliar&#34;&gt;For those unfamiliar,&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;slate your name&amp;rdquo; is a sentence actors hear a whole lot in auditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can ask you for all kinds of information in a &amp;ldquo;slate&amp;rdquo;. Your height, location, availability&amp;hellip; And actors try as quickly as possible to display their unique personality. Then it&amp;rsquo;s over, and your character takes over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this website is a chance for me to do more than just slate my name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want this to be a space where I can share my journey as an actor. But I don&amp;rsquo;t want it to be a highlights reel. I want to talk about my immigrant background and the hustle of surviving financially in NYC. I want to celebrate my wins and mourn my losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe it will help others in my situation feel less alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s the goal, anyway. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll speak more about my upbringing and my passion for acting in future posts. In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with this short first post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s to the ones who dream.&lt;/p&gt;
